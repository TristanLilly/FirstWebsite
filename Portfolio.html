    <h2><b>My Portfolio</b></h2>
 
        <p>These are just a few of the things ive done. I don't have a ton to show, but i'll be able to add more as I progress further in my degree.</p>

      
      <h2>My Computer</h2>

      <div class="image-grid"><img src="images/mypc.jpg" alt="mypc" width="300" height="300"></div>

      <p>This is the computer I had bought prebuilt roughly 4 years ago. I recently wanted to get more out of my computer and decided to upgrade some of the components. Quickly I found out that you have to be careful when upgrading parts because not every part works with everything else. So, I had to dump more money than intended into parts just to get the new graphics card I had bought to work. After that I had to dissassemble and learn what goes where and why. It quickly turned into a lengthy project, but when I finished it all works perfectly.</p>

      <h2>My Artwork</h2>

<div class="image-grid">
      <img  class="image-grid-col-2" src="images/drawing5.jpg" alt="Alien">
      <img src="images/drawing2.jpg" alt="Rams Head">
      <img src="images/drawing3.jpg" alt="Morbid Heart">
      <img src="images/drawing4.jpg" alt="Skull Heart">
      <img src="images/drawing1.jpg" alt="Heart">
</div>
<p>These are some drawings that I have done over the years. I started drawing when I was 14 years old and have progressively gotten better each time. My prefered style of art is more dark and morbid than most people, but because instructors have asked me in the past, I promise I am okay! I haven't done a ton of drawing or sketching this past year, but I plan on getting back into it soon.</p><br><br><br>
